DAG Tools for Unity is a code asset which acts as a bridge between the Ethereum VM and Unity3D.
It consists of a mature API for opening and converting almost all of the specification â€“ plus a set of editor
windows, example classes, and prefabs for quickly converting DAG blocks into fully functional Unity scenes.
